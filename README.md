# Data_Analysis_Side_Projects_Python
This repository contains the source code for five projects where I have explored the datasets and generated the findings in a clear and concise way.

The project details -
a) Created a Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation calculator.
b) Analyzed the demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.
c) Visualized and made calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas for a data set.
d) Visualized time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots.
e) Analyzed a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. Used the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
